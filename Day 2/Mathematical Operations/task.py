# print("My age: " + str(12)) ## Output will be 12

# print(123 + 456)
# print(7 - 3)
# print(3 * 2)
# print(6 / 3) # By default in Python the division is Float
# print(6 // 3) # If we include two "//" sign, this will provide an int output
# print(5 / 3)
# print(5 // 3)
# print(2**2) # This is "on power sign method" = 4
# print(2**3) # 2 * 2 * 2 = 3

##### PAUSE 1. What is the output of this code?
##### print(3 * 3 + 3 / 3 - 3)

## paste into Thonny and debug each step


##### PAUSE 2. Change the code so it outputs 3?
##### print(3 * 3 + 3 / 3 - 3)

##print(3 / 3 * 3 + 3 - 3) # I changed the calculation order

## This is how Angela did. She included Parenthesis which will prioritize the calculation 1st
print(3 * (3 + 3) / 3 - 3)

## Plug into Thonny and debug, you'll understand much more better
